    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      When you’ve had the best pizza in Naples Italy, it’s hard to go back. You
      know in the movie The Matrix when Neo is allowed to pick the blue and red
      pill, a choice between blissful ignorance or truth? Eating pizza in
      Naples, the place where pizza was invented, is like choosing the red pill.
      Once you’ve tasted Neapolitan pizza, you’ll never go back. Then you’ll
      spend the rest of your life trying to recreate it at home! Luckily, we did
      that for you. Here are all our tips and tricks for the best homemade
      Neapolitan pizza, so you can enjoy it for a lifetime!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pizza dough</li>
      <li>Pizza Sauce</li>
      <li>Fresh Mozzarella Cheese</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the dough using the Best Pizza Dough recipe (follow this video
        instruction for more). Follow the preparation instructions in the dough
        recipe if prepared in advance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your
        pizza oven (here’s the pizza oven we have!).
      </li>
      <li>Make the Homemade Pizza Sauce.</li>
      <li>
        Slice the mozzarella into ¼ inch thick pieces. If it’s incredibly watery
        fresh mozzarella (all brands vary), you may want to let it sit on a
        paper towel to remove moisture for about 15 minutes then dab the
        mozzarella with the paper towel to remove any additional moisture.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the oven is ready, stretch the dough into a circle; see How to
        Stretch Pizza Dough for instructions. Sprinkle a pizza peel with
        semolina flour or cornmeal, then carefully place the dough on top.
        Spread the pizza sauce across the dough. Top with mozzarella cheese.
        Taste a bite of the mozzarella cheese; if it does not taste salty, add a
        few pinches of kosher salt to the pizza.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you’re baking in a pizza oven, add the basil leaves. For baking in a
        standard oven, add the basil leaves after you bake (the leaves turn
        black in a standard oven).
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the pizza to the pizza stone on the pizza peel, then bake until
        the cheese is melted, about 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in the
        pizza oven). Slice into pieces and serve immediately.
